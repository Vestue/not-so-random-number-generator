# Not so random number generator
 A program that looks a simple random number generator but allows you to choose a specific number which will be generated upon the next roll.
 The user can input any chosen range and will then be given a random number once you press "generate".
 
 ## Examples
 - TODO: Add picutures showing default program UI and where to input the selected number.
