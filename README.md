# Not so random number generator
 A program that looks a simple random number generator but allows you to choose a specific number which will be generated upon the next roll.
 The user can input any chosen range and will then be given a random number once you press "generate".
 
 ## Examples
 - TODO: Add picutures showing default program UI and where to input the selected number.
### Default usage
Input a certain range and press generate to get a number within that range.

### Chosen number
Click the bottom left corner and type a number to guarantee that a certain number will be the next result. No indication will be given that you have entered a number into the "cheating box" so you could stream the number generation to other people amd they wouldn't be able to notice what you are doing.
